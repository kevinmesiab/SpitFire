# Bizzer
> "Get the dirt on a company...let us do the digging." ― Bizzer Slogan

Bizzer is a simple, responsive, single page web app written, then rewritten in different javascript libraries. 

## What's a Bizzer
### A Gossip
No, really, Bizzer's only purpose in life is to seek out as much chatter about a business it can dig up.

>“If you haven't got anything nice to say about anybody come sit next to me.” ― Alice Roosevelt Longworth


### A Scholar
When you type in the name of a company, Bizzer queries for bits of data from a growing number of APIs, and intelligently composes a visually stunning summary of a business and it's reputation in the wild. 

> "What good is all the world's knowledge when no one can make sense of it?" ― Unknown

### A Student
Taking 'good' design and translating between multiple js libraries is akin to translating *"The Dead Sea Scrolls,*  Sometimes, a bit of poetic license is necessary.

Building, then rebuilding Bizzer using different javascript frameworks is no simple task.  

>"You never stop learning. If you have a teacher, you never stop being a student." ― Elisabeth Rohm


### Forgiving
The code will be scrutinized by seasoned experts in each library, ridiculed by practicitioners of exotic programming methodologies, banished from Verona!  And this is desired...

Every design choice made, could have been made differently and achieved the same result. 

Engineering, like life, is quaint in that way.


> I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening." ― Larry King
 
## Goals
  
 1. Learn something.
 2. Build something with what I learned.
 3. Use that thing in which I built.

### Simplicity
  1. Markup whispers
  2. Code talks.
  3. Whitespace: valuable, yet inexpensive
  
### The 3 Axioms Of Refactorability
  1. This project will evolve.
  2. Technology will evolve.
  3. Design will promote co-evolution.
